Article 1

In this and the following articles I will attempt to describe in a semi-formal way a system that I have been thinking about for quite some time.

The system, which I will refer to as “falaina” for convenience, can be described using several terms that are commonly used in the programming community: declarative, fourth-generation ... . None of these accurately capture my intention with the design, which is perhaps why it has taken me so long to start writing this description.

Before I set about describing the falaina system, I must first make a digression to establish precisely what problems I aim to solve with this design. In laying out the issues with our current conception of the areas variously referred to as “programming”, “software engineering” and “coding”, I hope to bring at least as much value (or perhaps greater value) as I do by presenting the solution; since it may be that once identified, these issues can be solved in a better way by someone more capable or inspired than myself.

To begin with, I would like to describe the evolution of “programming" as I perceive it.

Humans have always gathered information about themselves and the world around them and used this to organise their efforts and become more efficient in their endeavours, whether that is agriculture, construction or warfare. Through history, better methods of counting and filling have enabled civilisations to make the most of limited resources.



In this way, programming is nothing more that describing information and how it should be manipulated and shared. When applied to digital computers,

As the possibilities of digital computers and telecommunications were realised, the expectations of their capabilities grew faster than the capabilities themselves. Thanks to the great intelligence and ingenuity of many engineers, techniques were developed to optimise the programs which helped mitigate the limitations imposed by the hardware of the time. Unfortunately, these optimisations further increased expectations on the performance of computers which required further 

As more and more focus was placed on the optimisation, the process that was being programmed lost importance. 

SAP does not adapt to a business, businesses adapt to SAP.

humans organise themselves through processes
as the processes become more complex, it is necessary to encode the rules somehow
sharing of information is difficult, it requires verbal communication or 
electronic computers changed that, making it faster to share and copy information
early hardware was limited and required optimisations to make it useful
users expectations of electronic computers grew faster than their capabilities, fuelled by the optimisations
soon, more focus was placed on the optimisations and less on the process itself
this was the basis of software engineering, which has now produced a whole culture focussed on the workings of the particular hardware and less on the actual process being “programmed”
this distraction has in my opinion caused us to lose our way, and is akin to an author spending more time thinking about the font and less about the story and characters
computers are powerful enough for us to stop thinking about the hardware and instead describe the information and processes that are allowed
