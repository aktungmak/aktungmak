The concept of small interconnected communities

all amenities are located within walking/cycling distance
public transport link individual communities
co-working spaces house employees from multiple companies in one location, and they use teleworking facilities to connect with their colleagues remotely
eliminate the need for extensive individual travel to commute etc
reduce crime and other social issues by building stronger communities
how would we transition from the current way of life to this kind of structure?
