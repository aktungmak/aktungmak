melee of suits

it's like Pokemon or magic but only using a deck of cards. two can play with one deck, or three or four using two decks

each person gets two whole suits, and then you shuffle each other's decks

first 3 cards are drawn as prizes and laid out to one side
next 5 cards are your hand

card roles:
KQJ: fighters with HP of 11, 12 and 13
10: skill (see below)
9: +2 potion
7, 8: +1 potion
2-6: energy cards
A: stone, deals 1HP damage to active or bench Pokemon

slots: 3x prizes, face down deck, face up discard, active, bench.

Turn Phases
1. at the beginning of your turn, you can send out one fighter or put it on the bench, if there is space.
2. next, you can play a number card (or stone)
3a. make an attack, if you have energy. the attack does the amount of damage equal to the card number. the energy card is discarded after the attack.
3b. instead of an attack, you can withdraw your active fighter as long as there is a benched fighter to take over.
3c. if you attack and the enemy Pokemon is KOd, it is shuffled into the discard pile with its energy and you get to add a prize to your hand.
4. draw up to two cards, as long as you don't exceed a total of 5. if the deck is exhausted, shuffle the discard pile and flip it over.

win condition:
a) collect all three prizes
b) KO the active Pokemon when there is no benched Pokemon to take over
if condition b) happens in a 3+ player game, the other players continue until condition a) or all players are out due to condition b)

special skills:
at the beginning of the game, each player cuts their deck and gets one of the following skills, depending what they draw. these can be used when a 10 is played in phase 2.

A: spare stone. the 10 acts as a stone also
2: healer. this card works like a +2 potion
3: recycle. in phase 4 you can choose to take one or both cards from the top of the discard pile
4: spook. force the other player to switch active and bench immediately
5: backstabber. send the active or bench fighter and any attached energy  to the discard pile. if you kill the active fighter, you must use your phase 3 to replace them with the bench fighter
6: bodyguard. the bench fighter takes all damage during the next turn on behalf of the active fighter
7: clueless. you have no skills! the 10 does nothing, send it straight to the discard pile
8. distract. force the other player to shuffle their hand into the deck and draw 5 cards (even if they had less before)
9. teamwork. you can do phase 3a and 3b in this turn, in either order.
10: movement surge. you can play phase 3 twice this turn
J: espionage. one other player must show you their hand, and you can check their prizes (without them seeing). you can spy on yourself, to check your prizes.
Q: transaction. without looking, shuffle your prizes into the discard pile and deal them again
K: necromancy. draw a fighter from the discard pile into your hand and then shuffle the discard pile

trading
after phase 4, players can trade cards in their hands with each other if they like.
also, in phase 4 the special skill can be used on other players if wanted, but they have to agree to it. eg you can't use backstabber on someone without them agreeing for you to do it.
